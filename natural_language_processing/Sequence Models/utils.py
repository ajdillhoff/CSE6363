        To be, or not to be, that is the question:
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
        And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
        To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause—there's the respect
        That makes calamity of so long life.
